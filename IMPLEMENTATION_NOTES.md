# Implementation Notes - Invoice Management & Notifications

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive invoice management and notification features to the Tim Harmar Legal Practice Management System.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Invoice Manager Component (`components/InvoiceManager.jsx`)
A full-featured invoice tracking and management interface with:

- **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows counts for total, draft, sent, paid, and overdue invoices, plus financial totals
- **Status Filtering**: Filter invoices by status (all, draft, sent, paid, overdue)
- **Invoice Actions**:
  - Mark as Sent: Records sent date and updates status
  - Mark as Paid: Records payment date and amount
  - Generate Follow-up: Creates new invoice with interest for overdue invoices
  - Export to PDF/Word: Placeholder buttons (ready for library integration)
- **Automatic Status Updates**: Invoices automatically become "overdue" when past due date
- **Interest Calculation**: Calculates interest based on days overdue and configurable rate

### 2. Notification Center Component (`components/NotificationCenter.jsx`)
A notification system for important events:

- **Notification Bell**: Displayed in top-right header with unread count badge
- **Notification Types**:
  - Overdue invoices (daily automatic checks)
  - Payment received confirmations
  - Custom reminders (extensible)
- **Notification Details**: Shows invoice number, client, amount, due date, days overdue
- **User Actions**:
  - Mark as read/unread
  - Delete notifications
  - Expandable details view
- **Smart Filtering**: Only shows unread count, prevents duplicate notifications

### 3. Enhanced Invoice Generator (`components/InvoiceGenerator.jsx`)
Updates to support new tracking features:

- **Status Tracking**: Invoices start as "draft" and progress through workflow
- **Matter Field**: Added client matter field for better organization
- **Settings Integration**: Uses firm settings for defaults (prefix, payment terms, interest rate)
- **Callback System**: `onSaveInvoice` callback to persist invoices to state

### 4. App.jsx Updates
Core application updates to integrate new features:

- **State Management**: Added `notifications` state with localStorage persistence
- **Invoice Handlers**:
  - `handleSaveInvoice`: Saves new/updated invoices
  - `handleUpdateInvoice`: Updates invoice status and creates notifications
- **Notification Handlers**:
  - `handleMarkNotificationAsRead`: Marks notification as read
  - `handleDeleteNotification`: Removes notification
- **Automatic Overdue Detection**: useEffect hook checks invoices daily for overdue status
- **UI Updates**:
  - Added notification bell button with unread badge
  - Added "Manage Invoices" button to Quick Actions
  - Pass settings to invoice components

## Data Structure

### Invoice Object
```javascript
{
  id: Number,                    // Unique identifier
  invoiceNumber: String,         // Invoice number (with prefix)
  clientName: String,            // Client name
  clientEmail: String,           // Client email
  clientAddress: String,         // Client address
  clientMatter: String,          // Matter description
  invoiceDate: String,           // ISO date string
  dueDate: String,               // ISO date string
  status: String,                // 'draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'overdue'
  sentDate: String | null,       // ISO date string when sent
  paidDate: String | null,       // ISO date string when paid
  paidAmount: Number | null,     // Amount paid (if different from total)
  interestRate: Number,          // Interest rate percentage
  entries: Array,                // Time entries included
  subtotal: Number,              // Subtotal before tax
  hst: Number,                   // HST/tax amount
  total: Number,                 // Total amount due
  notes: String,                 // Additional notes
  paymentTerms: String,          // Payment terms text
  createdDate: String            // ISO date string when created
}
```

### Notification Object
```javascript
{
  id: Number,                    // Unique identifier
  type: String,                  // 'overdue', 'payment', 'reminder'
  title: String,                 // Notification title
  message: String,               // Notification message
  date: String,                  // ISO date string
  read: Boolean,                 // Read status
  invoiceId: Number | null,      // Related invoice ID
  details: {                     // Additional details
    invoiceNumber: String,
    client: String,
    amount: String,
    dueDate: String,
    daysOverdue: Number
  }
}
```

## User Workflows

### Invoice Workflow
1. **Create Invoice**: Generate invoice from time entries (status: draft)
2. **Send Invoice**: Click "Mark as Sent" (status: sent, records sent date)
3. **Receive Payment**: Click "Mark as Paid" (status: paid, records payment date and amount)
4. **Handle Overdue**: System automatically updates status to overdue when past due date
5. **Follow-up**: Generate follow-up invoice with interest for overdue invoices

### Notification Workflow
1. **Automatic Creation**: System checks daily for overdue invoices and creates notifications
2. **Review**: User clicks notification bell to see all notifications
3. **Action**: User can mark as read or delete notifications
4. **Payment Confirmation**: When invoice is marked as paid, system creates payment notification

## Technical Details

### LocalStorage Keys
- `timetracker_invoices`: Array of invoice objects
- `timetracker_notifications`: Array of notification objects
- `timetracker_settings`: Settings object (includes default interest rate)

### Automatic Checks
- **Overdue Detection**: Runs on component mount and every 24 hours
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if notification already exists for invoice on same day
- **Status Update**: Automatically updates invoice status from 'sent' to 'overdue'

### Interest Calculation
```javascript
const dailyRate = interestRate / 100 / 365
const interest = invoiceTotal * dailyRate * daysOverdue
```

## Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

### Requires Backend Infrastructure
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Email notifications for overdue invoices
- Actual PDF/Word document generation
- Cloud storage for invoices and documents
- Payment gateway integration

### Requires Significant Development
- Screen recording features with AI analysis
- Timesheet template system with generation
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Batch invoice operations
- Recurring invoice automation

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create invoice and verify it appears in Invoice Manager
- [ ] Mark invoice as sent and verify sent date is recorded
- [ ] Mark invoice as paid and verify payment notification is created
- [ ] Create invoice with past due date and verify overdue notification appears
- [ ] Generate follow-up invoice and verify interest is calculated correctly
- [ ] Mark notification as read and verify badge count decreases
- [ ] Delete notification and verify it's removed
- [ ] Filter invoices by status and verify correct results
- [ ] Export buttons show appropriate messages

### Browser Compatibility
- Tested in Chrome/Chromium-based browsers
- Uses localStorage (IE11+, all modern browsers)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Notification Types
1. Add type to `NotificationCenter` component's `getNotificationIcon` function
2. Create notification object with appropriate type, title, and message
3. Add to notifications state using `setNotifications`

### Customizing Invoice Status Workflow
- Edit status values in `InvoiceManager` component
- Update status badge styling in `getStatusBadge` function
- Modify automatic status updates in `enrichedInvoices` useMemo hook

### Adjusting Interest Calculation
- Change default interest rate in Settings component
- Modify calculation formula in `InvoiceManager` component's `calculateInterest` function

## Performance Considerations

- LocalStorage has 5-10MB limit (sufficient for typical usage)
- Notification checks run every 24 hours (minimal performance impact)
- Invoice list renders efficiently with React's virtual DOM
- Status calculations use useMemo to prevent unnecessary recalculations

## Security Notes

- Data stored in browser localStorage (not suitable for sensitive production data)
- No authentication implemented (single-user demo application)
- For production use, implement:
  - Backend API with authentication
  - Encrypted data storage
  - HTTPS for all communications
  - User permission system
  - Audit logging
