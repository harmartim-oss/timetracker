## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow

```javascript
// Sign Up
signup(userData) → validate → hash password → save to localStorage → auto-login

// Login  
login(email, pass) → validate → check hash → load user → save session

// Session Persistence
On app load → check localStorage → restore user → redirect to app

// Logout
logout() → clear localStorage → redirect to landing
```

### Data Storage

**localStorage Keys:**
- `timetracker_users` - Array of user objects
- `timetracker_current_user` - Current session user
- `timetracker_clients` - Client data
- `timetracker_timeEntries` - Time entries
- `timetracker_invoices` - Invoices
- `timetracker_notifications` - Notifications
- `timetracker_settings` - App settings

### NLP Processing

**Pattern Recognition:**
```javascript
// Time patterns
/(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*(?:hours?|hrs?|h)/i
/(\d+)\s*(?:minutes?|mins?|m)/i

// Client patterns
/\b(?:for|client)\s+([A-Z][A-Za-z\s&.,']+?)(?:\s+on|\s+re:)/i
/\b([A-Z][A-Za-z\s]+(?:Inc|LLC|Ltd|Corp)\.?)/i

// Matter patterns
/\b(?:re:|regarding|about)\s+(.+?)(?:\s+for|\s+\d+|$)/i
```

**Confidence Scoring:**
```javascript
Overall = (time * 0.4) + (client * 0.3) + (matter * 0.2) + (area * 0.1)
```
