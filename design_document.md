# Design Document: AI-Powered Legal Practice Management Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design and architecture for a comprehensive, AI-powered legal practice management application for the law firm of Tim Harmar. The application will provide a modern, intuitive, and efficient solution for timekeeping, invoice generation, and practice management, with a strong emphasis on AI-driven features and a user experience consistent with the firm's branding.

## 2. Branding and User Interface

The application's user interface will be designed to align with the branding of the Tim Harmar law firm, as seen on www.timharmar.com. This includes:

*   **Color Palette:** The primary color scheme will be based on the blue, white, and grey tones from the website, creating a professional and trustworthy feel.
*   **Typography:** The application will use the same or similar modern, clean fonts as the website to ensure brand consistency.
*   **Logo:** The firm's logo will be prominently displayed in the application's header.
*   **Overall Aesthetic:** The UI will be clean, uncluttered, and intuitive, with a focus on user-friendliness for all three user roles: sole practitioner, office manager, and legal assistant.

## 3. Application Architecture

The application will be a single-page application (SPA) built with Angular. The architecture will be modular, with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and AI services.

*   **Frontend:** Angular will be used to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. The frontend will communicate with the backend via a RESTful API.
*   **Backend:** A Node.js backend with a framework like Express.js will handle business logic, data storage, and API endpoints. This will be a separate project from the frontend.
*   **Database:** A relational database like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB will be used to store user data, time entries, invoices, and other application data.
*   **AI/ML Services:** The AI-powered features will be implemented using Google's Gemini API and potentially other machine learning libraries. These services will be integrated into the backend.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1. Timekeeping

*   **Manual Time Entry:** Users will be able to manually enter time spent on specific tasks, associating each entry with a client and matter.
*   **Automatic Time Tracking:** The application will feature an AI-powered time tracking capability. This will involve analyzing user activity (e.g., open documents, emails, calendar events) to automatically generate time entries. The user will then be able to review and approve these suggestions.
*   **Timers:** A built-in stopwatch-style timer will allow users to track time in real-time.

### 4.2. Invoice Generation

*   **Automated Invoicing:** The application will automatically generate professional, branded invoices based on the recorded time entries for each client.
*   **Customizable Templates:** Invoice templates will be customizable to include the firm's logo, contact information, and other relevant details.
*   **Invoice Tracking:** The system will track the status of each invoice (e.g., sent, paid, overdue) and provide a dashboard for easy management.

### 4.3. AI-Powered Features

*   **Predictive Billing:** The application will use machine learning to analyze historical billing data and predict the likely cost of future legal matters. This will help with client communication and expectation management.
*   **Intelligent Task Suggestions:** The AI will suggest common tasks and time entry descriptions based on the type of legal matter, helping to streamline the timekeeping process.
*   **Legal Research Assistant:** Integration with a legal research API will allow users to perform legal research directly within the application.

## 5. User Roles and Permissions

The application will have three distinct user roles:

*   **Sole Practitioner (Admin):** Full access to all features, including billing rates, user management, and financial reporting.
*   **Office Manager:** Access to invoicing, reporting, and client management features.
*   **Legal Assistant:** Access to timekeeping and task management features.

## 6. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB
*   **AI/ML:** Google Gemini API, scikit-learn (for predictive billing)
*   **Deployment:** The application will be deployed to a cloud platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
